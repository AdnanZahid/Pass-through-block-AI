# Pass-through-block-AI

This is a simple AI that causes a ball to pass through a block.

*How to run:*

python AI.py

Written entirely in Python, it was a good project to practice python and get your hands clean.

This project uses re-inforcement learning by the following mechanism:

1. Green dots indicate successfully passing into the block
2. Red dots indicate crashing (failure)

It tries to make more green dots and avoid red dots.
